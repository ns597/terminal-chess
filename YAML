  Our project is a simulation of the two player game of chess. The interface
  displays the chessboard as well as the current location of the chess pieces.
  It also flips around to display the other playerâ€™s point of view after a turn,
  so players can take turns moving their pieces. The interface will indicate
  when a king is in checkmate, thus ending the game and offering a chance
  to restart the game.
